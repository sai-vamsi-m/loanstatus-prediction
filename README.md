# Loan Approval Status Prediction

  - This project focuses on predicting the loan approval status for applicants.
  - The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
  - The notebook contains the necessary steps to load and preprocess the loan dataset.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the dataset.
  - Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are implemented for loan approval status prediction.
  - The notebook includes data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
  - Model training and evaluation processes are carried out to assess the performance of different algorithms.
  - Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to evaluate the models.
  - The notebook also showcases how to tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search and Randomized Search.
  - The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation results and used to make loan approval status predictions.
  - The results and insights obtained from the analysis are presented in a clear and concise manner.
